# AttendenceProject
This is my project to track my attendence.

The main gole of this project is to track the attendence of mine, mainly I used html,css, javascript for form validation and php
via using these languages I created this project ,this application intracts with database (mysql) where I created two 
tables one of tracking the username pand his or her password and another one is for storing the attendence itself in this way 
completed this project I created it for my personal need becouse I was founding for a solution to keep my attendence safe 
then I think that I should make a web app for it and finally I made this application.
